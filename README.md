# Web Visualization Dashboard

# Lattitude - Weather Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I had created in a past project (https://github.com/melaniefollett/weather-python-api). In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages contained the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a landing page, a page where users can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where users can view the data used to build them.

# Website Summary

Landing page:
- An explanation of the project.
- Links to each visualizations page.

Four visualization pages, each with:
- A descriptive title and heading tag.
- The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

A "Comparisons" page:
- Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
- Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
- The grid is responsive to screen-size.

A "Data" page:
- Displays a responsive table (using bootstrap) containing the data used in the visualizations.


# Tools/Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS
- Pandas (to convert dataframe table to html table)

# Final Product
The website is available for viewing on GitHub pages (https://melaniefollett.github.io/web-visualization-dashboard/).
